TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or otherprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder orother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms ofthis Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or atable of data to be supplied by an application program that usesthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facilityis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply such function ortable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part ofits purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots hasa purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of theapplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this function mustbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the squareroot function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change inthese notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do oneof these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete correspondingmachine-readable source code for the Library including whateverchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed underSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linkedwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work thatuses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that theuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modifiedexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understoodthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in theLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the applicationto use the modified definitions.)

b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with theLibrary.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time acopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)will operate properly with a modified version of the library, ifthe user installs one, as long as the modified version isinterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no morethan the cost of performing this distribution.

d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the abovespecified materials from the same place.

e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,the materials to be distributed need not include anything that isnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same workbased on the Library, uncombined with any other libraryfacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of theSections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties withthis License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.
