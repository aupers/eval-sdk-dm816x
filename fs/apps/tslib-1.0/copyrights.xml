Copyright (C) 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USAEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copiesof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL.  It isnumbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away yourfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General PublicLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and changefree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Library General Public License, applies to somespecially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to anyother libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it foryour libraries, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, notprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that youhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge forthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get itif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of itin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbidanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you ifyou distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratisor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gaveyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the sourcecode.  If you link a program with the library, you must providecomplete object files to the recipients so that they can relink themwith the library, after making changes to the library and recompilingit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyrightthe library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legalpermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certainthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this freelibrary.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, wewant its recipients to know that what they have is not the originalversion, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect onthe original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by softwarepatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing freesoftware will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effecttransforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone'sfree use or not licensed at all.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinaryGNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  Thislicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certaindesignated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinaryone; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it isthe same as in the ordinary license.

The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is thatthey blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to aprogram and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, withoutchanging the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and isanalogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, ina textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, aderivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public Licensetreats it as such.

Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary GeneralPublic License for libraries did not effectively promote softwaresharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  Weconcluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.

However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive theusers of those programs of all benefit from the free status of thelibraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended topermit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, whilepreserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the freelibraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achievethis as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regardschanges in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that thiswill lead to faster development of free libraries.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution andmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  Theformer contains code derived from the library, while the latter onlyworks together with the library.

Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinaryGeneral Public License rather than by this special one.

GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSETERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library whichcontains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorizedparty saying it may be distributed under the terms of this LibraryGeneral Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee isaddressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or dataprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or workwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on theLibrary" means either the Library or any derivative work undercopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or aportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translatedstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation isincluded without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work formaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code meansall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associatedinterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilationand installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are notcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act ofrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output fromsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work basedon the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool forwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library doesand what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'scomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided thatyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy anappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intactall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of anywarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with theLibrary.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for afee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portionof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy anddistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent noticesstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at nocharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or atable of data to be supplied by an application program that usesthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facilityis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,in the event an application does not supply such function ortable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part ofits purpose remains meaningful.

(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots hasa purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of theapplication.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that anyapplication-supplied function or table used by this function mustbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the squareroot function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  Ifidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works inthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to thosesections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when youdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work basedon the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms ofthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to theentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wroteit.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contestyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is toexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative orcollective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Librarywith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume ofa storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work underthe scope of this License.

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General PublicLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To dothis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, sothat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of theordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specifythat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change inthese notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible forthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to allsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code ofthe Library into a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion orderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable formunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompanyit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, whichmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on amedium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy thesource code from the same place satisfies the requirement todistribute the source code, even though third parties are notcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of theLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled orlinked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such awork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, andtherefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Librarycreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because itcontains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses thelibrary".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header filethat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be aderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can belinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  Thethreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, datastructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inlinefunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the objectfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivativework.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of theLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you maydistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile orlink a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce awork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that workunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permitmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverseengineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that theLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered bythis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the workduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include thecopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a referencedirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do oneof these things:

a) Accompany the work with the complete correspondingmachine-readable source code for the Library including whateverchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed underSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linkedwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work thatuses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that theuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modifiedexecutable containing the modified Library.  (It is understoodthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in theLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the applicationto use the modified definitions.)

b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for atleast three years, to give the same user the materialsspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no morethan the cost of performing this distribution.

c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copyfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the abovespecified materials from the same place.

d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of thesematerials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses theLibrary" must include any data and utility programs needed forreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,the source code distributed need not include anything that is normallydistributed (in either source or binary form) with the majorcomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system onwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompaniesthe executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the licenserestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normallyaccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannotuse both them and the Library together in an executable that youdistribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on theLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other libraryfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combinedlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based onthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwisepermitted, and provided that you do these two things:

a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same workbased on the Library, uncombined with any other libraryfacilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of theSections above.

b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the factthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explainingwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distributethe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Anyattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, ordistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate yourrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,or rights, from you under this License will not have their licensesterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have notsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify ordistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions areprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, bymodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, andall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifyingthe Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on theLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from theoriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Librarysubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any furtherrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties tothis License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patentinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement orotherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do notexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannotdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under thisLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence youmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patentlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library byall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, thenthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be torefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under anyparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe anypatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of anysuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting theintegrity of the free software distribution system which isimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have madegenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributedthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of thatsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willingto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannotimpose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed tobe a consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted incertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, theoriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may addan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thusexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as ifwritten in the body of this License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or newversions of the Library General Public License from time to time.Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Libraryspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and"any later version", you have the option of following the terms andconditions either of that version or of any later version published bythe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify alicense version number, you may choose any version ever published bythe Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other freeprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which iscopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Ourdecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free statusof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharingand reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NOWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OROTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANYKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THEIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULARPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THELIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUMETHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO INWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFYAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOUFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL ORCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THELIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEINGRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR AFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IFSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCHDAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatestpossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software thateveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permittingredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of theordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It issafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectivelyconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/ormodify it under the terms of the GNU Library General PublicLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; eitherversion 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty ofMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNULibrary General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General PublicLicense along with this library; if not, write to the FreeSoftware Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston,MA 02111-1307, USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or yourschool, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, ifnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in thelibrary `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
